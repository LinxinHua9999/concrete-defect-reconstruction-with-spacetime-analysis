# RawData #

Here we have 6 videos for anyone who is interested to try. Those videos were taken by a GoPro HERO10 with "5k,60Hz, narrow" mode. The lens distortion was corrected with the built-in algorithm of the camera. A recording generally lasts for around 20 s with a frame rate of 59.9402 frame/sec. Each frame has 5312 ×
2988 pixels. 

I put them in a Google Drive folder and anyone with this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UA8Ou1_pZLtrN8g0FZ9s6NKGzCt6YxnV?usp=share_link) can easily download them. If you want to go through the example code, you need to download 1-2.MP4.

The following content describes the process of data collection, which comes from the section 3, Reconstruction of defects, of “[3D reconstruction of concrete defects using optical laser triangulation and modified spacetime analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580522003429)”:

A simple optical laser triangulation system has been built with a laser ray generator and a camera presented in Figure 13. A linear laser ray generator (MTO-laser MB-12A650-5-L) was mounted on a gantry robot (500 mm×1000 mm Newmark CS Series Belt Drive Linear Stage with a resolution of 3.6 μm). It can cast linear laser stripes onto the specimens and highlight the geometric transition on the scanned surfaces. The average width of the projected laser stripes onto the specimens was around 1.3 mm under the system settings in this work. A GoPro HERO10 camera was used to record the information of the reflected light, and it was fixed at a pre-defined position on a tripod. A lift table was used to enable easy adjustment for the object height. In this case, the object position can be quickly modified to guarantee that the object can be located at the centre of the images.
