## Reconstruction with modified spacetime analysis

In this folder, you can find two files. 

ObjectFoundMatrix.m is the function to calculate the global coordinates of the target using laser triangulation. It follows the description in section 2.1 of [3D reconstruction of concrete defects using optical laser triangulation and modified spacetime analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580522003429). 

Reconstruction\_ModifiedSpacetimeAnalysis_GoodLuckVersion.mlx is a MATLAB live script walking through all the steps to generate the point cloud. To run the code successfully, you need to download 1-2.MP4 from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UA8Ou1_pZLtrN8g0FZ9s6NKGzCt6YxnV).
