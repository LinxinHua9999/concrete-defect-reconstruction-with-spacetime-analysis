# 3D reconstruction of concrete defects using optical laser triangulation and modified spacetime analysis
This is an introduction and full explanation for “3D reconstruction of concrete defects using optical laser triangulation and modified spacetime analysis” (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580522003429).  
It aims to extract 3D information of concrete defects from small-to-medium-scale specimens using optical approaches. This work was inspired by Brian Curless and his team (http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/csl/tr/95/667/CSL-TR-95-667.pdf).
